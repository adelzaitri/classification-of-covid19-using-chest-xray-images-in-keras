# classification-of-covid19-using-chest-xray-images-in-keras

Goals:
======
* Predict whether a Chest X-ray if a COVID-19 diagnosis or not
* Build and Train the Convolutional Neural Network using Keras with Tensorflow as Backend
* Visualize Data in Matplotlib
* Make use of the Trained Model to Predict on a New Set of Data

Project Steps:
======
1. Introduction & Import Libraries
2. Clone and Explore Dataset 
3. Data Visualization
4. Data preprocessing and Augmentation
5. Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
6. Compile and Train the Model
7. Performance Evaluation
8. Prediction on New Data
